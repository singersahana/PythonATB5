# Checking for leap year or not ---> 2025

# Python program to check if year is a leap year or not
# To get year (integer input) from the user
year = int(input("Enter the year\n"))

# divided by 100 means century year (ending with 00)
# century year divided by 400 is leap year
if (year % 400 == 0) and (year % 100 == 0):
    print("{0} is a leap year".format(year))

# not divided by 100 means not a century year
# year divided by 4 is a leap year
elif (year % 4 ==0) and (year % 100 != 0):
    print("{0} is a leap year".format(year))

# if not divided by both 400 (century year) and 4 (not century year)
# year is not leap year
else:
    print("{0} is not a leap year".format(year))

print("----------------------------------------------------------------------------")

# The year is multiple of 400
# The year is multiple of 4 and not  a multiple of 100

# Optimization
def is_leap_year(year):
    if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):

        return False

# Example usage
year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

    print(f"{year} is a leap year.")
else:
    print(f"{year} is not a leap year.")
